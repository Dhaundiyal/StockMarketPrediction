# Stock Market Prediction Project

This project demonstrates Stock Market prediction using the Random Forest algorithm. It utilizes historical stock data from the S&P 500 index to predict whether the stock market will go up or down based on various features.

## Installation

Before running the code, make sure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance scikit-learn pandas

## Usage

    1.Import historical data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.
    2.Preprocess the data, including removing unnecessary columns and creating a target variable.
    3.Train a Random Forest classifier on the data.
    4.Evaluate the model's performance using precision score.
    5.Perform backtesting to assess the model's performance over time.
    6.Explore different horizons and additional features to improve predictions.
